# Drought prediction using weather and soil data

Using supervised ML, is it possible to predict drought (and its severity) with the help of weather and soil data?

This project uses datasets from kaggle.com and the SciKit Learn library to create a model to predict drought. The baseline accuracy was XX and the best accuracy score was 0.67 using LogReg and SVC models. Recall and precision scores were lower, at 0.6595. More information is available in the code and presentation.

## Conclusions
Using this model alone will not result in a highly accurate prediction. In order to get a higher score, other types of data that impacts drought should be included, e.g water levels in rivers and streams, air circulation patterns, and perhaps even water usage in the areas (from e.g agriculture). Nevertheless, this project acts as a good starting point for predicting drought and drought severity and contributes to a larger conversation about drought and its implications.
